# Little Odyssey - Source
 This repository contains almost all the code used in the game **Little Odyssey**.
## Contents
Little Odyssey was made with **UNITY**. This is only **CODE** of the game - it does no have things like art, sounds, music and others. I can't legally publish all of them. That's why you can't recreate the game only with those files - they are so you can take a look or I can find a job, but you won't be able to build them into anything useful. I was the only programmer of the game, that's why you won't see a lot of comment. Still, I think the code is pretty clear and readable, even if following non-standard naming conventions.
## Licence
 You are free to use this code however you see fit. **But some of the code here is not mine** - you will see comments describing where I got it from.
